## Summer Activities: I went to Disneyland with my friends, the day before school, for a birthday. She is a really close friend, so I wanted to celebrate before school. Another thing that I did over the summer was going to Las Vegas and Utah. I first went to Las Vegas with my family, but then, I met my friends at Zion Canyon and slept at their Airbnb, which was really nice at Utah.

## Goals for the School Year: My goal is quite common, but I would like to get amazing scores for my APs and earn great grades for every class. I want to get through this school year and have a fun time and actually learning for life, not just for school. 

## Summer Playlist: I have been listening to Bruno Mars, Laufey, and kpop during my summer and I enjoyed it. I still listen to my summer songs or artists right now. I would listen to a lot of Bruno Mars and Laufey with my friends. 

## Sports or Physical Activities: Over the summer, I played golf, which is a sport that I have been playing for a while. I practiced and I played with my family. During my summer, I had to go to summer school for PE, so I did a lot fo physical activities/ sports. I ran and, I played volleyball and improved. I learned how to play badminton and I got pretty good at it. 

## - Creative Endeavors: I tried new creative endeavors to see if I would enjoy them, so that I could have a new hobby. I drew, I played with clay, and I baked. I think out of those 3 creative endeavors, I enjoyed baking the most because the cookies that I made from scratch on my own was delicious (surprisingly).
